A repository pattern implementation for Code First. 

The compile library is avaliable on NuGet via 
	Install-Package StaticVoid.Core.Repository
or 
	http://nuget.org/packages/StaticVoid.Core.Repository

More information about how to use this solution and what the package does can be found on my blog here 
(http://blog.staticvoid.co.nz/2011/10/staticvoid-repository-pattern-nuget.html) 

This is intended for usage with an IoC repository injection pattern. To bind to the repository in Ninject simply use: 
	kernel.Bind(typeof(IRepositoryDataSource<>)).To(typeof(DbContextRepositoryDataSource<>)); 
	kernel.Bind(typeof(IRepository<>)).To(typeof(SimpleRepository<>)); 
this will allow you to inject repositories using the form IRepository<T> in your service implementations. 
Repository will have basic methods implemented for the type to allow crud.
